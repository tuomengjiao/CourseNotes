Lecture 1: The Learning Problem

The essence of machine learning:
	* A pattern exists.
	* We cannot pin it down mathematically.
	* We have data on it.

Components of learning:
	* Input: x
	* Output: y
	* Target funcion: f: x→y
	* Data: (x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)
	* Hypothesis: g: x→y

The 2 solution components of the learning problem:
	* The Hypothsis Set
	* The Learning Algorithm
Together, they are referred to as the learning model.

Basic premise of Learning
"using a set of observations to uncover an underlying process"
	* Supervised Learning
	* UnSupervised Learning
	* Reinforcement Learning (we get input, some output, grade for this output)
